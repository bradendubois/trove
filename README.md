# trove

A collection of random scripts I make for fun, to learn/teach something, or for some other project.

## Scripts

- **[Generics.java](https://github.com/bradendubois/trove/blob/master/Generics.java)** - An example of classes in Java implementing interfaces and utilizing generics.
- **[readme_generator.cpp](https://github.com/bradendubois/trove/blob/master/readme_generator.cpp)** - Used to generate a README (with a count of solutions!) for my [competitive-programming](https://github.com/bradendubois/competitive-programming) repo.
- **[some_stats.py](https://github.com/bradendubois/trove/blob/master/some_stats.py)** - Do some elementary statistics; created for an introductory statistics class.
- **[stacks_and_queues.py](https://github.com/bradendubois/trove/blob/master/stacks_and_queues.py)** - See a mixture of stacks and queues and how they affect the ordering of data.
